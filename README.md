# Pomofocus Clone

This is a simple clone of popular web app https://pomofocus.io 

## Description

I've been using pomofocus app for years now. After getting a grasp of web app programming I decided to make something of my own to show my skills. I enjoyed using pomofocus and I figured that the complexity of this project would fit my present skills.

## Demo

<pomo-clone.netlify.app>

## Usage

Key features include: 
- adding task to a task list
- crossing them with "check" button
- clearing all task (3 dots button above tasks)
- report to show a chart of recent acitivty
- timer with skip, pause etc.
- short breaks
- long breaks after 3 pomodoros 
- time estimation (you have to add a task for this feature to show)


## Project status

I am currently working on recent acivity chart. In the immediate future I am going to add backend to this project with node.js and postgreSQL.
